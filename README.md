# MAD-Project

The use of public transport as the main transport is still a choice for most of the population. People who are living in big cities often face problems to get the bus tickets. Normally, passengers book their tickets by phone call or using regular booking sites. In this methodology, bus owners also face big problems. Sometimes, they lose their money share as well. There happen lots of conflicts when seat booking. This project aims to develop the “GO” Bus Ticket Booking Mobile Application which aims to ease the process of buying the bus ticket more efficiently and quickly and develop a website for administrators to manage the bus booking system. 
"Go” is a smart useful app focus on transport that connects passengers with buses directly. The main intention of this app is to booking tickets via this app. Using this app passengers can save their time. They can book their seats and make their payment from credit cards or cash on. Every passenger can view details about buses and seats. Passengers need to create an account to use this app. As registered customers, they can book any number of available seats at any time through this app. In this app, we built up a admin roles or bus owner role as well.  Admin/bus owner can manage all functions. Such as add new buses to the system, update or delete saved details of buses and check or update route details. Once the reservation has been made online, passenger will receive a notification. Admin functions are also built into the app.


There are four functionalities we identified in this system
•	Payment Management
•	Ticket Booking and route Management
•	Transport Management by Admin
•	Profile Management
